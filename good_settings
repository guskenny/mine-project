good settings:

# value to limit number of blocks mined per period in random search
SCALED_RESOURCE=1.0

# number of trials to find boundary depth
FIND_DEPTH_TRIALS=1000

# depth of boundaries for local search
BOUND_DEPTH=1

# alpha value for reducing temperature in simulated annealing
SA_ALPHA=0.97

# minimum temperature value for simulated annealing
SA_T_MIN=0.01

# number of iterations for simulated annealing before reducing temp
SA_ITER=10

# number of runs of simulated annealing
SA_RUNS=4
